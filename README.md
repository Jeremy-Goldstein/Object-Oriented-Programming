# Object-Oriented-Programming-Games

The goal of this project was to demonstrate an understanding of the object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming properties of C++ by creating three games: Sudoku, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe">Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku">Gomoku</a>. 

To practice designing, implementing and debugging object-oriented software in accordance with the C++11 standard, a variety of fundamental C++ paradigms were employed in this project, including:
- Copy constructor
- Move constructor
- Copy-assignment operator
- Move-assignment operator
- Destructor
